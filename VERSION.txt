0.0.2

- Altered VoxelRenderer.MinLayer & VoxelRenderer.MaxLayer to be a single "min-max" struct `CullLayers`.
- Created "optimiser" workflow which should hopefully serve as a flexible framework for injecting arbitrary little bits of computation into the off-thread baking process.
- Moved internal face optimisation to new "optimiser" workflow.
- New voxel type: Voxel Sprites! Select any sprite texture and automatically generate a voxel object representation.
- Restructured threading architecture into `ThreadHandler` abstraction.
