1.0.0

- Implemented Voxel Brushes, which are like Voxel Materials but can generate a range of outputs (e.g. you can define a gradient and paint with random colours picked from the gradient)
- Breaking change: Updated `VoxelMaterialAsset` to `VoxelBrushAsset` containg a `VoxelBrush` instead of a `VoxelMaterial`.
- Breaking change: Changed most places you specify a material in the editor to VoxelBrushes for better painting.

0.0.3

- Significantly improved FaceMerger optimiser performance.
- Altered optimiser workflow significantly away from ScriptableObject.
- Added initial unit test suite.
- New experimental feature: MagicaVoxel .vox file import. Restrictions: Can only import single-object files with simple nodes.
- Fixed bug where collider meshes were being recreated on every invalidation.
- Moved voxul into its own assembly for faster compilation times when included within a project.
- Improved SceneView picking so you don't have to lock the inspector anymore when painting
- New experimental feature: Render plane LOD generation
- New experimental feature: Reduce LOD generation
- New experimental feature: Warp tool, can apply a per-vertex warping as a post-process on voxels.
	- TODO: move to it's own little "processer/effector" system
- Added rough lightmap generation suppor. Breaking change: vertex aux data is now on UV3.
- Made it so the renderer gameobject's first subrenderer is itself instead of a new child. This improves object picking (you can now click on renderers in the scene again) and prefabs (there aren't weirdly named temp-looking objects in prefabs anymore). Multiple objects will still be used for very detailed voxel meshes.
- Changed all Texture2D Reinitilize calls to Resize so it compiles on 2020.3.22f1

0.0.2

- Altered VoxelRenderer.MinLayer & VoxelRenderer.MaxLayer to be a single "min-max" struct `CullLayers`.
- Created "optimiser" workflow which should hopefully serve as a flexible framework for injecting arbitrary little bits of computation into the off-thread baking process.
- Moved internal face optimisation to new "optimiser" workflow.
- New voxel type: Voxel Sprites! Select any sprite texture and automatically generate a voxel object representation.
- Restructured threading architecture into `ThreadHandler` abstraction.

0.0.1

- Initial release.
