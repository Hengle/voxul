0.0.3

- Significantly improved FaceMerger optimiser performance.
- Altered optimiser workflow significantly away from ScriptableObject.
- Added initial unit test suite.
- New experimental feature: MagicaVoxel .vox file import
	- Restrictions: Can only import single-object files with simple nodes.
- Fixed bug where collider meshes were being recreated on every invalidation.
- Moved voxul into its own assembly for faster compilation times when included within a project.
- Improved SceneView picking so you don't have to lock the inspector anymore when painting
- New experimental feature: Render plane LOD generation
- New experimental feature: Reduce LOD generation

0.0.2

- Altered VoxelRenderer.MinLayer & VoxelRenderer.MaxLayer to be a single "min-max" struct `CullLayers`.
- Created "optimiser" workflow which should hopefully serve as a flexible framework for injecting arbitrary little bits of computation into the off-thread baking process.
- Moved internal face optimisation to new "optimiser" workflow.
- New voxel type: Voxel Sprites! Select any sprite texture and automatically generate a voxel object representation.
- Restructured threading architecture into `ThreadHandler` abstraction.
